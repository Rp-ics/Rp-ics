Python developer specialized in FastAPI and automation.

I design and build backend services, APIs and automated workflows.
I also have years of experience teaching Python, which translates into
clean architecture, readable code and strong fundamentals.

## Focus
- FastAPI (REST APIs, validation, auth)
- Automation & scripting
- Data handling and integrations

## Projects
Here are some projects that represent how I work:
- [Telegram Bot with AI](https://github.com/Rp-ics/Telegram-AI-Bot)
- [Instagram Automation](https://github.com/Rp-ics/Instagram-Automation-Bot)

## Background
I’ve taught Python for years to a wide range of students.
Now I focus on building production-oriented software.

## What I'm aiming for
I'm building my GitHub as a professional portfolio to showcase real-world
Python projects and clean code.
